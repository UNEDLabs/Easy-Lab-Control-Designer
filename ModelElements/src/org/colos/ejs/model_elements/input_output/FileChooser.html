    <p>
      A file chooser encapsulates calls to OSPRuntime methods that let you choose a file for reading or writing.
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
      To add a file chooser reader element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your model elements and 
      set the "Description"  and "Extensions" fields to a constant String (as in "My files" and "xml,txt", respectively) 
      or link them to String model variables (as in <i>%myModelString%</i>).
      </p>
      <p>Use the buttons to the right of the fields for easier selection.
    </p>
    <p>
    A call to the element method <i>String chooseFilename(Component _parentComponent, boolean _toSave)</i> will let you choose a file and return its name. 
    The name is returned relative to your simulation's home directory.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <i>_parentComponent</i> argument instructs the file chooser to appear on top of one of your view (Swing-based) elements. Using your main window is just fine. 
    The <i>_toSave</i> boolean argument indicated whether you want this fale to save or read from it. This has the only eect of preparing the labels of the fiel chooser accordingly.
    </p>
    <h3>Example of use</h3>
    <pre>
    String filename = fileChooser.chooseFilename(_view.mainFrame,false); // false = to read from it
    // Now, do whatever you want with this filename (like passing it to a variable linked to a DataReader element)...
    </pre>
  </body>
