    </h2>
    <p>
      EjsSServerSimulation encapsulates a WebSocket server to send/receive data to/from a remote EjsS WebSocket client. 
      This element (differently to the basic WebSocketServer) implements a particular API for
      communicating from this Java program (which typically acts as a model that provides data) to a remote
      JavaScript EjsS simulation (which typically acts as a view). See EjsSClientSimulation model element 
      for JavaScript simulations. 
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
      To add an EjsSServerSimulation element to your program, drag the icon element to the 
      list of your model elements and 
      set the "Port" field to a constant integer (as in 8800, for example). If the port
      is set, the service starts automatically. If the port is not set, then an explicit
      call to <tt>start(portNumber)</tt> is required.
      </p> 
      <p>
      	By default, the server waits for 30 seconds before proceeding with the simulation, 
      	aborting it if no client connects to it. If all clients disconnect, it also waits
      	a number of seconds before exiting the simulation.
      	You can change the number of seconds to wait using the <tt>setWaitTime(seconds)</tt>
      	method. 
      </p>
      <p>Optionally, modify the method that will be called if a message is received via the WebSocket connection.
      This method is called only if none of the predefined command keywords is detected. Predefined keywords 
      always start with an underscore character '_' (your extended API, if any, should therefore avoid this). 
    </p>
    <h3>Connection methods</h3>
    <p>
    The element implements the following connection methods:
    <ul>
    <li> <i>void start(int portNumber)</i> Starts the server service at the given port.</li>
    <li> <i>void setWaitTime(int seconds)</i> Sets the number of seconds
    	to wait for a connecting client, before exiting. Setting a time of 0 makes the
    	server to wait for ever.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean isConnected()</i> Whether there is a client connection open.</li>
    <li> <i>int getPortnumber()</i> Returns the port number in which the serve runs.</li>
    <li> <i>void stop()</i> Stops the server service at the given port.</li>
    <li> <i>String[] getConnectionsIDs()</i> Reruns an array with the connected clients.</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Output methods</h3>
    <p>
    The API also includes the following output communication methods. All communication methods  return a true boolean 
    if successful, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li> <i>boolean sendCommand(String keyword, Object... args)</i>. 
      Sends the connected clients a command with a keyword and the values of one or more arguments.
      The receiving model is responsible of processing the message through the user-defined
      processing <i>function(String keyword, Object args)</i> for the input. (The object arguments 
      has members of the form arg1, arg2, etc.) Example:
      <pre>
      function (keyword, args) { // At the JavaScript client simulation
        if (keyword=="hello") console.log ("Hello world: "+args.arg1);
      }
      </pre>
      Note: Do NOT use a keyword that starts with an underscore character '_'.
    </li>
    <li> <i>boolean sendVariables(String keyword, String... variables)</i>. 
      Sends the connected clients a command with a keyword and the values of one or more variables of this 
      simulation's model.
      The receiving model is responsible of processing the message through the user-defined
      processing <i>function (String keyword, Object args)</i> for the input. (The object arguments 
      has members with the same names of the model variables) Example:
      <pre>
      ejssServer.sendVariables("update","t","x"); // In this simulation
      </pre>
      <pre>
      function (keyword, args) { // At the JavaScript client
        if (keyword=="update") console.log ("Value of (t,x) = ("+args.t+","+args.x+")");
      }
      </pre>
      Note: Do NOT use a keyword that starts with an underscore character '_'.
    </li>
    <li> <i>boolean sendStatus()</i>. Sends the connected clients information about the playing status.
    </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>
    Because the WebSocket client is typically an EjsS-generated simulation, the API also 
    includes the following connection methods. They all use the sendCommand() method above, with
    predefined keywords that all start with an underscore character '_'. Hence, for instance,
    <i>client_play()</i> equals to <i>sendCommand("_play")</i>.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li> <i>boolean client_play()</i>. Equivalent to _play() in the remote client.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean client_pause()</i>. Equivalent to _pause() in the remote client.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean client_step()</i>. Equivalent to _step() in the remote client.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean client_reset()</i>. Equivalent to _reset() in the remote client.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean client_update()</i>. Equivalent to _update() in the remote client.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean client_initialize()</i>. Equivalent to _initialize() in the remote client.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean client_resetSolvers()</i>. Equivalent to _resetSolvers() in the remote client.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean client_alert(String message)</i>. Equivalent to alert(message) in the remote client.</li>
    <li> <i>boolean client_println(String message)</i>. Equivalent to _println(message) in the remote client.</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
    <h3>Input methods</h3>
    <p>
    This WebSocket server can also receive messages from the client. When this happens, some messages can
    correspond to predefined commands but others are left for the user to process. The commands are
    distinguished by a String keyword. Predefined commands have keywords that start with an underscore 
    character '_' (such as "_play") and are generated by client functions (such as <i>server_play()</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Messages that are not recognized as predefined commands are passed to a user-defined 
      <i>void processCommand(String keyword, Map<String,Object> data)</i>
      method. It is the user responsibility to implement the proper response to the command. 
      A simple implementation of <i>processCommand</i> follows:
      <pre>
      processCommand(String keyword, Map<String,Object> data) { // At this Java simulation
        if (keyword.equals("values")) {
          double t = getDouble(data,"t");
          double x = getDouble(data,"x");
          System.out.println ("Value of (t,x) = ("+t+","+x+")");
        }
      }
      </pre>    
      This example uses one of the element's utility methods:
      <ul> 
        <li><i>double getDouble(Map<String,Object> data, String variable)</i>. This method basically
          calls <i>data.get("t")</i> but takes care of possible conversion problems (sometimes,
          JavaScript variables can be coded as integers and one expects a double).
        </li>
        <li><i>double getString(Map<String,Object> data, String variable)</i>. 
          This method returns the String associated to this variable name. Returns null
          if the variable is not defined.
        </li>
      </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>
    Alternatively, users interested in information about the client that sent the message can, instead, 
    override the base class  
      <i>void processCommand(org.java_websocket.WebSocket socket, String keyword, Map<String,Object> data)</i>
      method. It is the user responsibility to implement the proper response to the command. 
      The <i>socket</i> parameter can then be used to discriminate among clients.
    </p>
    <p>
    If both methods are implemented, <i>processCommand(WebSocket, String, Map)</i> will be used and 
    <i>void processCommand(String, Map)</i> will be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, users interested can also run code when a new connection is established or an open connection 
    is closed. For this, override the dummy base class 
      <i>void onConnectionOpened(org.java_websocket.WebSocket socket)</i> 
      and or
      <i>void onConnectionClosed(org.java_websocket.WebSocket socket)</i>
      methods.  
      The <i>socket</i> parameter refers to the newly opened or just closed client. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Example of use</h3>

      ejssServer.sendVariables("update","t","x"); // In this simulation
    </pre>
