    </h2>
    <p>
      A resource finder encapsulates access to the ResourceLoader class in the OSP library, allowing
      easy access to files in the JAR file of the simulation, on the applet server, or anywhere else in the file path.
    </p>
    <p>
    Files located by resource finder can provide any type of data, though some types, like text, images, and audio, can be quickly read
    using particular convenience methods.
      </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
      To add a resource finder element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your model elements and 
      set the "File to read" field to a file in your hard disk (under your simulation directory) 
      or link it to a String model variable (as in <i>%myModelString%</i>).
      </p>
      <p>
      You can also leave the "File to read" field empty and then use convenience methods provided by the
      element which accept a particular file path.
      </p>
    <p>
    A call to any of the element's convenience methods will attempt to read the file 
    and return the data requested, if successful, or null if it failed to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
    The most popular convenience methods are the following:
    <ul>
      <li> <i>String getString(String path)</i>. Returns the whole content of the file as a single String. </li>
      <li> <i>ImageIcon getIcon(String path)</i>. Returns the ImageIcon contained by a graphic file. </li>
      <li> <i>Image getImage(String path)</i>. Returns the Image contained by a graphic file. </li>
      <li> <i>BufferedImage getBufferedImage(String path)</i>. Returns the BufferedImage contained by a graphic file. </li>
      <li> <i>AudioClip getAudioClipString path()</i>. Returns the AudioClip contained by a sound file. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Next methods provide direct access to reading objects, which will allow you to read directly from the file, in any suitable format:
    <ul>
      <li> <i>InputStream openInputStream(String path)</i>. Opens an InputStream to allow reading the contents of the file. </li>
      <li> <i>Reader openReader(String path)</i>. Opens a Reader to allow reading the contents of the file. </li>
      <li> <i>Resource getResource(String path)</i>. Opens a Reader to allow reading the contents of the file. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
     <p>
    All these convenience methods have a variant that allows reading a particular file (different from the one 
    specified in the "File to read" field). As, for example, <i>String getString(String path)</i>.
    </p>
   <p>
    The element uses the OSP core class <a href="http://www.um.es/fem/Javadoc/OSP_EJS/org/opensourcephysics/tools/ResourceLoader.html">ResourceLoader</a>.
    Additional configuration capabilities are possible addressing directly the static methods of this class.
    </p>
    <h3>Example of use</h3>
    <pre>
String content = resourceFinder.getString();
if (content==null) {
  _println("Could not read text from file: "+resourceFinder.getFilename());
  return;
}
// Now, do whatever you want with the content
_println("Text read from file: "+resourceFinder.getFilename());
_println (content);
    </pre>
  </body>
