    </h2>
    <p>
     This element defines a new Robotics Lab
     
    </p>
    <p> 
    The element encapsulates access to a new Java library, a framework designed specifically for manipulator robots that implements all the functions
    and algorithms necessary for the modeling of robotics systems. 
      </p>
      </p>  This element has been designed to coordinate the motion of several robots. 
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
      To add a RoboticsLab element to your model, drag-and-dropping the RoboticsLab element of our robotic model elements. This action adds both the model 
      and the view features of a Robotics lab to an existing EJS simulation.
      </p>
      Then, the author instructs the RoboticsLab element to coordinate (previously added) individual robots using the addRobot(robot) method 
      and completes the design of the lab with other components using the addComponent(component) method.  
      This is typically done in an EJS model Initialization page. 
      </p>
     
      <p> The RoboticsLab API provides methods to move the robots that will internally check and avoid collisions of any part of a robot with any other:
    <ul>
      <li><i>public void moveRobot(AbstractRobot robot, double [] q)</i>: Moves the robot to the given joint position </li>
      <li><i>public void trajectoryStep(AbstractRobot robot, double step)</i>: Moves the robot to the next point of the trajectory </li>
