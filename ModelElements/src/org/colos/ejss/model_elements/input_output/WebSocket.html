    </h2>
    <p>
      WebSocket encapsulates a WebSocket server to send/receive data from a client.
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
      To add a WebSocket element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your 
      model elements and optionally set one (but not both) of the fields:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Setting the "Service" field states that you want to send an HTTP request to a web server
          that will run a JAVA program and return network information
          (in the form of an object with a <tt>webserver</tt> String) for the client to connect to 
          a WebSocket server run by this program at an appropriated IP and port. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting the "IP:portnumber" field states that you want the client to connect to 
          a WebSocker server running at the specified IP and portnumber.</li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The client will not attempt any connection if both fields are left empty. In this case, an explicit call
      to  <tt>start(String url)</tt> or <tt>startFromService(String url)</tt> is required prior to send
      any communication command.
      </p>
      <p>
      	By default, the client waits for 30 seconds before proceeding with the simulation, 
      	aborting it if no server connects to it. If the server disconnects or any communication
      	error is issued, the connection is considered closed (and you will need to start it again).
      	You can change the number of seconds to wait using the <tt>setWaitTime(seconds)</tt>
      	method. 
      </p>
      <p>Typically, you will need to modify the method that will be called if a message is received via the WebSocket connection.
    </p>
    <h3>Connection functions</h3>
    <p>
    The element implements the following connection methods:
    <ul>
      <li> <i>void start(String url)</i>. Listen to the given url (in the form "ws://ip:port")</li>
      <li> <i>void startFromService(String url)</i>. 
           Send a GET HttpRequest to the given url and read the response <i>webserver</i> field.
           Then call <i>start(response.webserver)</i></li>
      <li> <i>void setWaitTime(int seconds)</i>. Sets the number of seconds
    	   to wait for a connecting server, before signaling an error. Setting a time of 0 makes the
           client to wait for ever.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean isConnected()</i>. Whether the connection is open.</li>
      <li> <i>void stop()</i>. Stops listening to the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Output functions</h3>
    <p>
      The API also includes the following output communication method. All communication methods 
      return a true boolean if successful, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <i>boolean sendMessage(String message)</i>. 
        Sends the connected server the given String message.
        The receiving model is responsible of processing the message through the user-defined
        <i>void processInput (WebSocket socket, String input)</i> or 
        <i>void processInput (String input)</i> method. See the WebSocket Server
        model element for Java EjsS simulations.
        Example:
        <pre>
ejssClient.sendMessage("Hello world");
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h3>Input functions</h3>
    <p>
      This WebSocket client is designed to receive messages from the server. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Messages to a user-defined function that must process it. 
      This function has the following signature:
      <i>function(message)</i>. 
      It is the user responsibility to implement the proper response 
      to the message. 
      An example that deals with a simple message:
      <pre>
      function (message) { // At the JavaScript client simulation
        if (message=="hello") {
          // The server issued ejssServer.sendMessage("hello"). 
          console.log ("The server says :  "+message);
        }
      }
      </pre>    
    </p>    
    
    <p>
    Finally, users interested can also run code when a new connection is established or an open connection 
    is closed. For this, set the element methods 
      <i>onConnectionOpened(event)</i> 
      and/or
      <i>onConnectionClosed(event)</i>.
      The <i>event</i> parameter refers to the newly opened or just closed event. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Example of use</h3>
    <pre>
    webSocketClient.sendMessage("t="+t);
