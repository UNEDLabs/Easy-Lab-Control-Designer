    </h2>
    <p>
      EjsSClientSimulation encapsulates a WebSocket client to send/receive data to/from a remote EjsS 
      server simulation. 
      This element (differently to the basic WebSocket element) implements a particular API for
      communicating from this JavaScript program (which typically acts a a view) 
      to a Java EjsS simulation (that typically acts as a model and provides data).
      See the EjsSServerSimulation model element for Java simulations. 
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
      To add an EjssClient Model element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your 
      model elements and optionally set one (but not both) of the fields:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Setting the "Service" field states that you want to send an HTTP request to a web server
          that will run a JAVA program and return network information
          (in the form of an object with a <tt>webserver</tt> String) for the client to connect to 
          a WebSocket server run by this program at an appropriated IP and port. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting the "IP:portnumber" field states that you want the client to connect to 
          a WebSocker server running at the specified IP and portnumber.</li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      The client will not attempt any connection if both fields are left empty. In this case, an explicit call
      to  <tt>start(String url)</tt> or <tt>startFromService(String url)</tt> is required prior to send
      any communication command.
      </p>
      <p>
      	By default, the client waits for 30 seconds before proceeding with the simulation, 
      	aborting it if no server connects to it. If the server disconnects or any communication
      	error is issued, the connection is considered closed (and you will need to start it again).
      	You can change the number of seconds to wait using the <tt>setWaitTime(seconds)</tt>
      	method. 
      </p>
      <p>Optionally, modify the method that will be called if a message is received via the WebSocket connection.
      This method is called only if one of the predefined messages is not detected. Predefined messages 
      always start with an underscore character '_' (your extended API, if any, should therefore avoid this). 
    </p>
    <h3>Connection functions</h3>
    <p>
    The element implements the following connection methods:
    <ul>
      <li> <i>void start(String url)</i>. Listen to the given url (in the form "ws://ip:port")</li>
      <li> <i>void startFromService(String url)</i>. 
           Send a GET HttpRequest to the given url and read the response <i>webserver</i> field.
           Then call <i>start(response.webserver)</i></li>
      <li> <i>void setWaitTime(int seconds)</i>. Sets the number of seconds
    	   to wait for a connecting server, before signaling an error. Setting a time of 0 makes the
           client to wait for ever.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean isConnected()</i>. Whether the connection is open.</li>
      <li> <i>void stop()</i>. Stops listening to the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Output functions</h3>
    <p>
      The API also includes the following output communication methods. All communication methods 
      return a true boolean if successful, false otherwise.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <i>boolean sendCommand(keyword, data)</i>. 
        Sends the connected server a command with a String keyword and an Object data.
        The receiving model is responsible of processing the message through the user-defined
        <i>void processCommand(String keyword, Map<String,Object> data)</i> method. See the EjsSServerSimulation
        model element for Java EjsS simulations.
        Example:
        <pre>
var t = 0, x = 0.1;
ejssClient.sendCommand("values", { "t" : t, "x" : x });
        </pre>
        Note: Do NOT use a keyword that starts with an underscore character '_'.
      </li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p>
      Because the WebSocket server is typically an EjsS-generated simulation, the API also 
      includes the following connection functions. They all use the sendCommand() function above, with
      predefined keywords that all start with an underscore character '_'. Hence, for instance,
    <i>server_play()</i> equals to <i>sendCommand("_play")</i>.
    <ul>
      <li> <i>boolean server_play()</i>. Equivalent to _play() in the remote server.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean server_pause()</i>. Equivalent to _pause() in the remote server.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean server_step()</i>. Equivalent to _step() in the remote server.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean server_reset()</i>. Equivalent to _reset() in the remote server.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean server_update()</i>. Equivalent to _update() in the remote server.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean server_initialize()</i>. Equivalent to _initialize() in the remote server.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean server_resetSolvers()</i>. Equivalent to _resetSolvers() in the remote server.</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Input functions</h3>
    <p>
      This WebSocket client is designed to receive messages from the server. 
      When this happens, some messages can correspond to predefined commands but others are left for the user to process. The commands are
      distinguished by a String keyword. Predefined commands have keywords that start with an underscore 
      character '_' (such as "_play") and are generated by specific server functions (such as <i>client_play()</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Messages that are not recognized as predefined commands are passed to a user-defined function
      that must process the command. This function has the following signature:
      <i>function(keyword, data)</i>. It is the user responsibility to implement the proper response 
      to the command. There are two types of non-predefined messages, generated by the server's
      <i>sendCommand()</i> and <i>sendVariables()</i> messages. They differ only in the way they name
      the arguments. An example that deals with both cases follows:
      <pre>
      function (keyword, args) { // At the JavaScript client simulation
        if (keyword=="hello") {
          // The server issued ejssServer.sendCommand("hello","A message to the world"): 
          // In this case, args are named "arg1", "arg2", etc...
          console.log ("Hello world: "+args.arg1);
        }
        else if (keyword=="values") {
          // The server issued ejssServer.sendVariables("values","t","x"); 
          // In this case, args are named as the corresponding server variables
          console.log ("Value of (t,x) = ("+args.t+","+args.x+")");
        }
      }
      </pre>    
    </p>
    <h3>Utility functions</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, the element implements some utility functions: 
    <ul>
      <li> <i>boolean isServerPlaying()</i>.  Whether the server is playing. Equivalent to _isPlaying() in the remote server.</li>
      <li> <i>boolean isServerPaused()</i>.   Whether teh server is paused. Equivalent to _isPaused() in the remote server.</li>
      <li> <i>String toJSON(data)</i>.  Returns a JSON String coding of an object.</li>
      <li> <i>var fromJSON(data)</i>.   Recovers an object from its String JSON coding.</li>
      <li> <i>void setID(anId)</i>.   Tells the server to identify this client with the given string.</li>
      <li> <i>void getConnectionList(listener)</i>.   Tells the server to send a message with the list of connected clients. 
      The list is passed to the listener function, which must have a signature like this: <i>function(String[] list)</i>
      </li>
      <li> <i>boolean isServiceSpecifiedByPage()</i>.   
      Parses the search string of the page, if any, and returns true if there is any server information there
	  to specify a server and/or port load the HTML page as http://wahtever/page.html?url=aURL & portnumber=aPort.
	  Returns true if there is any server information.
	  </li>
      <li> <i>String getServiceInformation()</i>.   
	   Parses the search string of the page, if any, and returns the desired server URL and portnumber
	   to specify a server and/or port load the HTML page as http://wahtever/page.html?url=aURL & portnumber=aPort.
	   Returns an object describing the server { url, port}. 
	  </li>
      
    </ul> 
    </p>
    <h3>Example of use</h3>
    <pre>
    ejssClient.sendCommand("init_conditions", { "t" : t, "x" : x });
    ejssClient.server_play();
    </pre>
