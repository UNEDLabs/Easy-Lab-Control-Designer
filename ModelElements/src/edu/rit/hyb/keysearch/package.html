<BODY>

Package edu.rit.hyb.keysearch
contains sequential and hybrid SMP cluster parallel programs
for a cryptanalysis problem.
We are given a 128-bit plaintext block,
the corresponding 128-bit ciphertext block
encrypted using AES with a 256-bit key,
and a portion of the key.
The problem is to find the rest of the key
using exhaustive search.

<P>
The hybrid SMP cluster parallel programs in this package use Parallel Java (PJ)
in package <A HREF="../../pj/package-summary.html">edu.rit.pj</A>.
