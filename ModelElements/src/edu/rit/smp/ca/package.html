<BODY>

Package edu.rit.smp.ca
contains sequential and SMP parallel programs
for computing images of cellular automata (CAs).
These are typically parallel problems with sequential dependencies
that can take advantage of overlapped computation and I/O.

<P>
The SMP parallel programs in this package use Parallel Java (PJ)
in package <A HREF="../../pj/package-summary.html">edu.rit.pj</A>.
