Package edu.rit.draw
contains classes and programs for drawing
diagrams and slides of all kinds.

<P>
To create a drawing or slide,
first create an instance of class <A HREF="Drawing.html">Drawing</A>.
Next, create a number of <B>drawing items</B>
and add each one to the drawing.
Package <A HREF="item/package-summary.html">edu.rit.draw.item</A>
contains classes for various kinds of drawing items
such as lines, arrows, rectangles, ellipses, and text.
Finally, store the drawing object in a file
using the static <TT>Drawing.write()</TT> method.

<P>
To view a drawing or slide, run the viewer program,
class <A HREF="../../../View.html">View</A>,
specifying the drawing file on the command line.
The viewer program lets you save the drawing
in a PNG file or a PostScript file.

<P>
Future versions of package edu.rit.draw
will include a WYSIWYG application for creating and viewing drawings
as well as applications for creating and running slide shows.
