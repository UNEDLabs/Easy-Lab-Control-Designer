/**
 * Class WorkerIntegerStrideForLoop is the abstract base class for one variation
 * of a worker for loop that is executed inside a {@linkplain WorkerRegion}. The
 * loop index data type is <TT>int</TT>. The loop stride is explicitly
 * specified.
 * <P>
 * To execute a worker for loop, create a {@linkplain WorkerRegion} object;
 * create an instance of a concrete subclass of class
 * WorkerIntegerStrideForLoop; and pass this instance to the worker region's
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method. Either every worker team thread must call the
 * worker region's <TT>execute()</TT> method with identical arguments, or every
 * thread must not call the <TT>execute()</TT> method. You can do all this using
 * an anonymous inner class; for example:
 * <PRE>
 *     new WorkerRegion()
 *         {
 *         . . .
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             execute (0, 98, 2, new WorkerIntegerStrideForLoop()
 *                 {
 *                 // Thread local variable declarations
 *                 . . .
 *                 public void start()
 *                     {
 *                     // Per-thread pre-loop initialization code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 public void run (int first, int last, int stride)
 *                     {
 *                     // Loop code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 public void finish()
 *                     {
 *                     // Per-thread post-loop finalization code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             }
 *         . . .
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * In each process of a cluster parallel program, the worker team has one or
 * more worker threads. Every worker thread in every process has a unique worker
 * tag, going from tag 0 for the first worker thread in the first process to tag
 * <I>K</I>&minus;1 for the last worker thread in the last process, where
 * <I>K</I> is the total number of worker threads in all the processes. In
 * addition, in one process there is a master thread. The worker and master
 * threads all call the worker region's <TT>execute()</TT> method to execute the
 * worker for loop. However, the worker and master threads differ in their
 * actions.
 * <P>
 * The master thread does the following. The master obtains the worker for
 * loop's schedule as returned by the <TT>schedule()</TT> method. The range of
 * loop indexes is divided into "chunks" and the chunks are apportioned among
 * the workers in accordance with the schedule. The master repeatedly sends
 * "tasks" to the workers and receives "responses" from the workers. To send a
 * task to a particular worker, the master (1) sends a message containing the
 * chunk index range to the worker's process; and (2) calls the worker for
 * loop's <TT>sendTaskInput()</TT> method. This method's default implementation
 * does nothing, but it can be overridden to send additional task input data to
 * the worker. To receive a response from a particular worker, the master (1)
 * receives a message containing the chunk index range from the worker's
 * process; and (2) calls the worker for loop's <TT>receiveTaskOutput()</TT>
 * method. This method's default implementation does nothing, but it can be
 * overridden to receive additional task output data from the worker. Once all
 * tasks have been sent to the workers and all responses have been received from
 * the workers, the master returns from the worker region's <TT>execute()</TT>
 * method.
 * <P>
 * Each worker thread does the following. The worker calls the worker for loop's
 * <TT>start()</TT> method once before beginning any loop iterations. The worker
 * repeatedly receives tasks from the master and sends responses to the master.
 * To receive a task from the master, the worker (1) receives a message
 * containing the chunk index range from the master's process; and (2) calls the
 * worker for loop's <TT>receiveTaskInput()</TT> method. This method's default
 * implementation does nothing, but it can be overridden to receive additional
 * task input data from the master. The worker now calls the worker for loop's
 * <TT>run()</TT> method, passing in the chunk index range lower and upper
 * bounds. When the <TT>run()</TT> method returns, the worker sends the response
 * to the master. To send the response, the worker (1) sends a message
 * containing the chunk index range to the master's process; and (2) calls the
 * worker for loop's <TT>sendTaskOutput()</TT> method. This method's default
 * implementation does nothing, but it can be overridden to send additional task
 * output data to the master. Once all tasks have been received from the master
 * and all responses have been sent to the master, the worker calls the worker
 * for loop's <TT>finish()</TT> method. (Unlike a {@linkplain ParallelTeam}'s
 * threads, the workers do <I>not</I> synchronize with each other at a barrier
 * at this point.) The worker then returns from the worker region's
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * If the worker for loop has a fixed schedule (in which there is exactly one
 * chunk with a predetermined index range for each worker), then the messages
 * containing the chunk index range are omitted, and each worker gets its chunk
 * index range directly from the fixed schedule. However, the task input data
 * (if any) and task output data (if any) are still sent and received.
 * <P>
 * Each message described above is sent with a message tag equal to
 * <I>W</I>+<I>T</I>, where <I>W</I> is the worker index and <I>T</I> is the
 * "tag offset." The tag offset is <TT>Integer.MIN_VALUE</TT> by default, but
 * this can be changed by overriding the <TT>tagOffset()</TT> method. Thus, the
 * message tags fall in the range <I>T</I> .. <I>K</I>&minus;1+<I>T</I>, where
 * <I>K</I> is the total number of workers in all the processes. The program
 * should not use message tags in this range except to send and receive the
 * messages described above.
 * <P>
 * Note that each worker team thread actually creates its own instance of the
 * worker for loop class and passes that instance to the worker region's
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method. Thus, any fields declared in the worker for loop
 * class will <I>not</I> be shared by all the workers, but instead will be
 * private to each worker.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>start()</TT> method is intended for performing per-thread
 * initialization before starting the loop iterations. If no such initialization
 * is needed, omit the <TT>start()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>run()</TT> method contains the code for the loop. The first and last
 * indexes for a chunk of loop iterations are passed in as arguments. The loop
 * stride, which is always positive, is also explicitly specified as an
 * argument. The worker for loop's <TT>run()</TT> method must be coded this way:
 * <PRE>
 *     public void run (int first, int last, int stride)
 *         {
 *         for (int i = first; i &lt;= last; i += stride)
 *             {
 *             // Loop body code
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * with the loop indexes running from <TT>first</TT> to <TT>last</TT> inclusive
 * and increasing by <TT>stride</TT> on each iteration.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>finish()</TT> method is intended for performing per-thread
 * finalization after finishing the loop iterations. If no such finalization is
 * needed, omit the <TT>finish()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * If the worker for loop's <TT>start()</TT>, <TT>run()</TT>, or
 * <TT>finish()</TT> method throws an exception in one of the worker threads,
 * then that worker thread executes no further code in the loop, and the worker
 * region's <TT>execute()</TT> method throws that same exception in that thread.
 * However, the other worker threads in the worker team continue to execute.
