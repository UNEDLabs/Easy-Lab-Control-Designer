<BODY>

Package edu.rit.pj.cluster contains client and server programs
for message passing parallel programming using Parallel Java (PJ).
PJ message passing programs use class
<A HREF="../Comm.html">edu.rit.pj.Comm</A>,
and class Comm in turn uses package edu.rit.pj.cluster.
PJ message passing programs
do not use package edu.rit.pj.cluster directly.
For further information about PJ,
see package <A HREF="../package-summary.html">edu.rit.pj</A>.

<A NAME="operation"><H2>PJ Cluster Operation</H2></A>

<P>
A cluster parallel computer typically consists of a frontend node
and one or more backend nodes
connected via a dedicated high-speed network.
To run a PJ message passing program on a cluster parallel computer,
several things must be set up first:
<UL>
<LI>
Set up a configuration file
on the frontend node
containing information about the cluster.
For further information,
see class <A HREF="Configuration.html">Configuration</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
Run the PJ Job Scheduler Daemon on the frontend node.
This allows the PJ message passing program
to determine which backend nodes are available
for running a process.
The Job Scheduler Daemon reads the configuration file
to get information about the cluster.
For further information,
see class <A HREF="JobScheduler.html">JobScheduler</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The PJ message passing program uses the Secure Shell (SSH)
to start a backend process in the user's account
on each backend node.
Therefore, it must be possible to do an SSH remote login
from the frontend node to each backend node.
Each backend node must have SSH enabled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
Furthermore,
it must be possible to do an SSH remote login
from the frontend node to each backend node
<I>without the user having to type a password.</I>
This is done using public key authentication.
SSH must have public key authentication enabled.
Each user must set up SSH public and private keys
in his or her account.
For further information,
refer to the SSH documentation.
</UL>

<P>
Once the above setup has been done,
you can run a PJ message passing program
that uses class <A HREF="../Comm.html">edu.rit.pj.Comm</A>
on the frontend node.
Class Comm in turn uses a <A HREF="JobFrontend.html">JobFrontend</A>.
The job frontend contacts the Job Scheduler Daemon
running on the frontend node
to start a parallel processing job
using a given number of backend nodes.
If there are not enough idle backend nodes,
the job frontend waits until there are enough.
Once the backend nodes have been assigned to the job,
the job frontend prints the job number
and the names of the backend nodes.
Using SSH, the job frontend then starts
a <A HREF="JobBackend.html">JobBackend</A> process
on each backend node.
The job backend processes
run in the user's account,
and they run in the same current directory
as the job frontend process.
The job backend processes execute the parallel program,
passing messages among themselves.
The job backend processes' standard output and standard error streams
are redirected to the job frontend process,
which copies them to its own standard output and standard error.

<P>
The Job Scheduler Daemon uses the <I>nn,</I>
<I>np,</I> and <I>nt</I> settings to assign resources to a job.
These settings are specified by the <TT>-Dpj.nn</TT>,
<TT>-Dpj.np</TT>, and <TT>-Dpj.nt</TT> flags
on the <TT>java</TT> command line; for example:
<PRE>
    $ java -Dpj.np=4 . . .
</PRE>
For further information, see class
<A HREF="../PJProperties.html">edu.rit.pj.PJProperties</A>.
<P>
If neither <I>nn</I> nor <I>np</I> is specified, the Job Scheduler will run
the job with one process on one node.
<P>
If <I>nn</I> or <I>np</I> is specified but not both, the Job Scheduler will
run the job on <I>nn</I> (or <I>np</I>) nodes with one process on each node.
<P>
If <I>nn</I> and <I>np</I> are both specified and <I>nn</I> &gt;= <I>np</I>,
the Job Scheduler will run the job on <I>np</I> nodes with one process on
each node.
<P>
If <I>nn</I> and <I>np</I> are both specified and <I>nn</I> &lt; <I>np</I>,
the Job Scheduler will run the job on <I>nn</I> nodes with with more than one
process on some or all of the nodes, apportioning the <I>np</I> processes as
equally as possible among the <I>nn</I> nodes. Note that in this case,
different nodes may be assigned different numbers of processes.
<P>
On each node, the Job Scheduler will assign <I>nt</I> CPUs to each process.
If <I>nt</I> is not specified, the default is to use all the CPUs in the
node, apportioning the CPUs as equally as possible among the processes on the
node. Note that in this case, different processes may be assigned different
numbers of CPUs.

<P>
The Job Scheduler Daemon has a web interface
that lets you examine the cluster status
as well as the detailed status of each job in the queue.
Just point your web browser at this URL:
<PRE>
    http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8080/
</PRE>
where <TT>&lt;hostname&gt;</TT> is replaced by
the host name of the frontend node.
The default port for the cluster status web interface is port 8080.
The Job Scheduler Daemon can be configured to use a different port.
For further information,
see class <A HREF="Configuration.html">Configuration</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="configuration"><H2>PJ Cluster Configuration</H2></A>

<P>
Here are three examples showing how the PJ cluster middleware is configured
to run on the RIT Computer Science Department's parallel computers.
For further information about configuring the Job Scheduler Daemon,
see class <A HREF="Configuration.html">Configuration</A>.

<P>
<B>Paranoia Cluster</B>

<P>
The Paranoia cluster consists of a frontend node,
hostname <TT>paranoia.cs.rit.edu</TT>,
and 32 backend nodes,
hostnames <TT>thug01</TT> through <TT>thug32</TT>.
The frontend node is a Sun Microsystems
UltraSPARC-II CPU with a 296 MHz clock and 192 MB of main memory.
Each backend  node is a Sun Microsystems
UltraSPARC-IIi CPU with a 440 MHz clock and 256 MB of main memory.
The cluster machines are interconnected
via a dedicated 100 Mbps switched Ethernet.
The frontend node also has a connection to the campus network.

<P>
Here is the configuration file for the Job Scheduler Daemon.
It is stored in the file <TT>"/var/tmp/parajava/scheduler.conf"</TT>
on the <TT>paranoia.cs.rit.edu</TT> machine.

By saying <TT>webhost paranoia.cs.rit.edu</TT>,
a user can view
the Job Scheduler Daemon's job status web interface
from any machine in the Internet.
However, by saying <TT>schedulerhost localhost</TT>,
a user must log into the <TT>paranoia.cs.rit.edu</TT> machine
to run PJ jobs.
(Since the Job Scheduler process is listening to <TT>localhost</TT>,
the job frontend process must be running on the same host
as the Job Scheduler process
in order for the job frontend process
to communicate with the Job Scheduler process.)

<P>
Although the backend nodes are not "server-class" machines,
we want to run the Hotspot Server JVM on the backend nodes anyway.
Thus, each <TT>backend</TT> entry
includes the <TT>-server</TT> JVM flag
to force the Hotspot Server JVM to run.

<P>
Here are the commands to run the Job Scheduler Daemon

<B>Parasite Machine</B>

<P>
The Parasite machine is not actually a cluster parallel computer,
rather it is a single SMP parallel computer.
The PJ cluster middleware is used
to run a job queue for the Parasite machine,
ensuring that only one job runs at a time on the Parasite machine.

<P>
The Parasite "cluster" consists of a frontend node,
hostname <TT>paragon.cs.rit.edu</TT>,
and one backend node,
hostname <TT>parasite.cs.rit.edu</TT>.
The backend node is a Sun Microsystems machine
with four Sun UltraSPARC-IV dual-core CPUs (eight CPUs total),
a 1.35 GHz clock speed, and 16 GB of main memory.

<P>
Here is the configuration file for the Job Scheduler Daemon.
It is stored in the file <TT>"/var/tmp/parajava/scheduler.conf"</TT>

A PJ message passing program running on a PJ cluster
is a distributed system comprising four kinds of processes:
<UL>
<LI>
Job Scheduler Daemon,
class <A HREF="JobScheduler.html">JobScheduler</A>.
<LI>
SSH Daemons.
<LI>
Job frontend process, class <A HREF="JobFrontend.html">JobFrontend</A>.
<LI>
Job backend processes, class <A HREF="JobBackend.html">JobBackend</A>.
</UL>

<P>
The Job Scheduler Daemon,
a process always running on the frontend node,
has a channel group
(class <A HREF="../../mp/ChannelGroup.html">ChannelGroup</A>)
that is listening for connections to a well-known port on localhost.
The default PJ port is 20617.

<P>
Each backend node has an always-running SSH Daemon process,
typically a system process.

<P>
The Job Scheduler Daemon is configured
with the following information,
provided in a configuration file
(see class <A HREF="Configuration.html">Configuration</A>):
<UL>
<LI>
File name for logging Job Scheduler actions.
<LI>
Host and port for Job Scheduler's web interface for displaying status.
<LI>
Host to which job frontend processes will listen for connections
from job backend processes.
<LI>
Port to which Job Scheduler is listening for connections
from job frontend processes (default 20617).
<LI>
For each backend node:
<UL>
<LI>
Backend node's name.
<LI>
Number of CPUs.
<LI>
Host name for SSH remote login to the backend node.
<LI>
Full pathname for executing the Java Virtual Machine on the backend node.
<LI>
Java class path for the PJ Library on the backend node.
<LI>
JVM command line flags (zero or more).
<LI>
Shell command string (default: <TT>"bash -l -c"</TT>).
</UL>
</UL>

<P>
The user starts things off
by running a PJ message passing program
that calls the <TT>Comm.init()</TT> method
(see class <A HREF="../Comm.html">Comm</A>).
The <TT>Comm.init()</TT> method
creates an instance of class <A HREF="JobFrontend.html">JobFrontend</A>,
the job frontend object takes over execution,
and the user's process becomes the job frontend process.

<P>
The job frontend process begins
by setting up three channel groups;
each channel group is listening for connections
to a separate host and port:
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>
The "middleware channel group"
is for the PJ middleware itself.
The job frontend process uses the middleware channel group
to communicate with the Job Scheduler Daemon
and the job backend processes.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The "world channel group"
is used to implement the "world communicator,"
which the parallel program uses to do message passing.
All the job backend processes, 
but not the job frontend process,
are part of the world communicator.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The "frontend channel group"
is used to implement the "frontend communicator,"
which the parallel program can also use to do message passing.
All the job backend processes
<I>and</I> the job frontend process
are part of the frontend communicator.
(Actually, the frontend communicator is optional.
A flag on the <TT>Comm.init()</TT> method
says whether to create the frontend communicator.)
</OL>

<P>
Next, the job frontend process
opens a connection to the Job Scheduler Daemon.
(If the Job Scheduler Daemon is not listening to the default PJ port,
the user must specify the <TT>"-Dpj.port="</TT> flag
on the Java command line when running the PJ program.)
The job frontend process and the Job Scheduler Daemon
exchange the following messages during the course of the job:

</PRE>
The Job Scheduler Daemon renews a lease on the job frontend process,
and vice versa,
by sending a "renew lease" message
every 60 seconds.
If one side fails to receive a "renew lease" message
for 150 seconds,
the lease expires.
If the lease expires,
that process assumes the process at the other end has failed,
and the process takes the appropriate actions to abort the job.

<P>
The Job Scheduler Daemon sends messages to the job frontend process
to assign a job number for the job
and to assign backend processes, <I>np</I> of them, to the job.
When a backend process is assigned to run on a backend node,
the job frontend process performs an SSH command
to log into the user's account on the backend node;
the requisite host name is given
in the "assign backend" message.
The job frontend process tells SSH
to execute the following command string on the backend node:
<PRE>
bash -l -c "cd '&lt;dir&gt;'; nohup &lt;jvm&gt; -classpath '&lt;classpath&gt;' &lt;jvmflags&gt; \
edu.rit.pj.cluster.JobBackend &lt;args&gt; &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null &amp;"
</PRE>
After verifying the user using public key authentication,
SSH executes a shell (bash) using the command above.
The default shell command is <TT>"bash&nbsp;-l&nbsp;-c"</TT>,
but this can be changed in the configuration file.
The <TT>-l</TT> flag tells the shell to behave as a login shell
and execute the commands in the user's login profile, if any.
The <TT>-c</TT> flag tells the shell
to execute the command between the double quotation marks.
Executing that command,
the shell changes the working directory
to the job frontend process's working directory,
<TT>&lt;dir&gt;</TT>.
Then the shell executes a Java Virtual Machine
using the <TT>&lt;jvm&gt;</TT> command
from the configuration file.
This JVM becomes the job backend process.
The Java class path is <TT>&lt;classpath&gt;</TT>
from the configuration file.
Any JVM flags from the configuration file (<TT>&lt;jvmflags&gt;</TT>),
as well as any flags the user specified on the command line
with the <TT>-Dpj.jvmflags</TT> property,
are included.
The main program class is
<A HREF="JobBackend.html">JobBackend</A>,
followed by class JobBackend's command line arguments.
The job backend process's standard output and standard error streams
are redirected to <TT>/dev/null</TT>;
the job backend process will intercept these streams
and send them to the job frontend process.
The job backend process is set to ignore hangup signals (<TT>nohup</TT>).
The shell and the SSH session terminate
without waiting for the job backend process to terminate
(because of the trailing <TT>&amp;</TT>).
This leaves the job backend process running in the background
on the backend node.

<P>
Note that the SSH command string uses Unix shell syntax.
If this syntax is not appropriate for the job backend nodes,
the code in class <A HREF="JobFrontend.html">JobFrontend</A>
must be changed to emit the proper command string.

<P>
The job backend process
sets up its middleware channel group,
world communicator, and frontend communicator
using the information supplied in the command line arguments,
which were specified by the job frontend process
when it performed the SSH command.
The job frontend process and the job backend process
exchange the following messages during the course of the job
using the middleware channel group:

</PRE>

<P>
The job backend process begins by sending a "backend ready" message
to the job frontend process with the following information:
<UL>
<LI>
Job backend process's rank.
<LI>
Host and port for the job backend process's middleware channel group.
<LI>
Host and port for the job backend process's world communicator.
<LI>
Host and port for the job backend process's frontend communicator
(if the frontend communicator exists).
</UL>
Once all the job backend processes have reported ready,
the job frontend process sends a "commence job" message
to each job backend process with this information:
<UL>
<LI>
Array of hosts and ports for the middleware channel group.
<LI>
Array of hosts and ports for the world communicator.
<LI>
Array of hosts and ports for the frontend communicator
(if the frontend communicator exists).
<LI>
Names and values of all defined Java system properties.
<LI>
Fully qualified class name of the Java main program class to execute.
<LI>
Java command line arguments (array of 0 or more strings).
</UL>
Once the job commences running,
the job frontend process and job backend processes
exchange further messages as shown above.

<P>
In summary,
the messages sent from and to each process are:
