    </h2>
    <p>
        A RIP model element provides an implementation of the Remote Interoperability Protocol (RIP) API.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
        To add a RIP model element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your model elements and set the
        name of the variable for referring to the element.
        The connection can be configured in the preferences window, the address of the server, and the port to establish
        the connection.

        The links between the EJS variables and the server variables also can be done in this window.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main methods of the API are:
    </p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>connect()</i>: Creates a new connection with a RIP Server.</li>
        <br>
        <li><i>open()</i>: Opens a resource.</li>
        <br>
		<li><i>get()</i>: Reads one or more variables. </li>
        <br>
		<li><i>set()</i>: Writes one or more variables.</li>
        <br>
        <li><i>step()</i>: Writes one or more variables, execute a command and read one or more variables. </li>
        <br>
        <li><i>close()</i>: Closes an opened resource.</li>
        <br>
        <li><i>disconnect()</i>: Disconnects from server.</li>
	</ul>
    <h3>Example of use</h3>
    <p>    
    	The following code is usually included into an initialization page, and it must be executed to set up the connection (we use <i>ripclient</i> as instance name of the element)
    </p>
    <pre>
        ripclient.connect();
    </pre>    
    <p>
        The following code is usually included into an evolution page, to exchange data periodically with the server.
    </p>
    <pre>
        ripclient.step();
    </pre>   
    <p>   	
        The following code must be executed to finalize the execution properly.
    </p>
    <pre>
        ripclient.disconnect();
    </pre>
