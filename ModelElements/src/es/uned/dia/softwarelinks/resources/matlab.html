    <p>
      A RIP-Matlab model element provides an implementation of the Remote Interoperability Protocol (RIP) and encapsulates the connection with Matlab software to control the execution of a VI.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
      To add a RIP-Matlab model element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your model elements and
      set the name of the variable for referring to the element.
      The connection can be configured in the preferences window: the
      address of the server, the port to establish the connection and, optionally, the variables that should be automatically synchronized
      between EJS and MATLAB.
      </p>
    <p>

  The RIP protocol provides an API to communicate with the server. The methods are categorized by functionality:
	Connection control:
	<ul>
		<li> <i>connect()</i> Creates a new connection with MATLAB.</li>
    <li> <i>disconnect()</i> Disconnects from MATLAB Server.</li>
  </ul>
  Data transmission:
  <ul>
		<li> <i>get(String[] variables)</i> Get the value of variables from the server.</li> 	
		<li> <i>set(String[] variables, Object values[])</i> Set the value of variables in the server.</li> 	
	</ul>
  Command execution:
  <ul>
    <li> <i>eval(String command)</i> Evaluates a MATLAB command.</li>  
  </ul>

  Calling get() and set() method without arguments synchronizes only the variables defined in the element configuration dialog.

    </p>
    <h3>Example of use</h3>
    <p>    
    	The following code is usually included into an initialization page, and it must be executed to set up the connection (we use <i>matlab</i> as instance name of the element)
    </p>
    <pre>
matlab.connect();
    </pre>    
    <p>
    The following code is usually included into an evolution page, to exchange data periodically with the server.
    </p>
    <pre>
matlab.step();
    </pre>
    <p>   	
    The following code must be executed to finalize the execution properly.
    </p>
    <pre>
matlab.disconnect();
    </pre>
