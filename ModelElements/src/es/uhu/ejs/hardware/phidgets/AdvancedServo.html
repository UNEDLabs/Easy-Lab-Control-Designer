<h2> <img style="width: 32px; height: 22px;" alt="TextLCD"
 src="MotorControlHC.png"> Phidget Advanced Servo Controller<strong>
(like the 1061 and 1066)</strong></h2>
<p> This element allows you access
to a&nbsp; Phidget AdvancedServo Controller&nbsp;device.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The PhidgetAdvancedServo 8-Motor (1061) allows you to control the
position, velocity, and acceleration of up to 8 RC servo motors. It
requires a 6-15VDC external power supply; its switching power supply
allows the 1061 to efficiently operate from 6 to 15 VDC and can be used
with a wide range of batteries.&nbsp;The 1061 has a high resolution of
125 steps per degree; it measures the power consumption of each servo
and its switching regulator protects the motors from overvoltage. It
powers servo motors of up to 3.4 Amps.&nbsp;The 1061 continuously
measures the current consumed by each motor with an accuracy of
&plusmn;10%.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The PhidgetAdvancedServo 1-Motor (1066) allows you to control the
position, velocity, and acceleration of one RC servo motor. The 1066 is
powered solely by the USB cable &ndash; no additional power source is
required.&nbsp;The 1066 has a high resolution of 125 steps per degree;
it measures the power consumption of the servo, and powers servo motors
of up to 450mA.&nbsp;The AdvancedServo connects directly to a
computer&rsquo;s USB port.
With this element, you can
access to the module directly (with the
serial number) or through the network, using the WebService of the
phidget's driver&nbsp;
in a remote computer with the phidget AdvancedServo Controler
connected (here, you need the IP, port and password too). </li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p> To use any Phidget element,
drag an drop its icon to the list of
model elements of your model. Then, edit the connection parameters and
invoke <i>phidget.connect()</i>
in your code. </p>
<p> All methods returning a
boolean will return <i>true</i>
on
successful completion of the command, <i>false</i>
otherwise. Methods
returning a double value will return <i>Double.NaN</i>
if there is any
error when connecting to the phidget. </p>
<p>Available method for this
particular phidgets include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">public boolean connect();</span>
// establish the connection. Returns true if successful</li>
</ul>
