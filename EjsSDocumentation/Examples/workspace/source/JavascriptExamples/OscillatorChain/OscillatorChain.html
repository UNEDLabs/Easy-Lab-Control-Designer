      Coupled Oscillator Chain
    </h1>
    <p>
      &quot;<i>The investigation by John and Daniel Bernoulli [of the coupled 
      oscillator chain] may be said to form the beginning of theoretical 
      physics as distinct from mechanics, in the sense that it is the first 
      attempt to formulate the laws of motion of a system of particles rather 
      than that of a single particle.</i>&quot; Leon Brillouin</p>

      <i>Oscillator Chain </i>models a one-dimensional linear 
      array of coupled harmonic oscillators with fixed ends. This model can be used to study 
      the propagation of waves in a continuous medium and the vibrational 
      modes of a crystalline lattice. The Ejs model shown here contains 31 
      coupled oscillators equally spaced within the interval [0, 2 &#960;] with 
      fixed ends. The <i>m</i>-th normal mode of this system can be observed 
      by entering f(x) = sin(m*x/2) as the initial displacement where m is an 
	  integer.</p><p>
      &nbsp;</p>
	<p>
      Wave 
      propagation can be studied by entering a localized pulse or by setting 
      the initial displacement to zero and dragging oscillators to form a wave 
      packet. An interesting and important feature of the Oscillator Chain 
      model is that the speed of a sinusoidal wave along the oscillator array 
      depends on its wavelength. This causes a wave packet to disperse (change 
      shape) and imposes a maximum frequency of oscillation (cutoff frequency) 
      as is observed in actual crystals.
