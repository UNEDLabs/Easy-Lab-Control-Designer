      Oscillator Chain Model

    <p>
      Let y<sub>i</sub>= y(x<sub>i</sub>,t) represent the time-dependent displacement of a 
      particle of mass M with horizontal position x<sub>i</sub>.&nbsp; Each particle is coupled to its nearest neighbors with a 
      spring in order to form a chain of oscillators.&nbsp; It is assumed that the particles move only in the <i>y-</i>direction and 
      that the force F<sub>i</sub> 
      on the i-th particle depends on the relative displacement 
      between that particle and its nearest neighbors. The force on the <i>i</i>-th particle can be written as

      where K is the Hook's law coupling constant. Because the first and last particles 
      in the lattice are fixed, we compute particle accelerations starting 
      with the second particle and continuing through the lattice until we 
      reach the next-to-last particle. This, the particles in a chain with N oscillators are labeled [0, 1, 2, <sup>....</sup> 
      N-1, N, N+1].</p>

      One way of understanding a chain of N coupled oscillators of length L 
      and mass M is to study the motion of its normal modes. A normal mode is 
      a special configuration (state) where every particle moves sinusoidally 
      with the same angular frequency &#969;<sub>m</sub>. The <i>m</i>-th mode &#934;<sub>m</sub> of the 
      oscillator chain of length L is

      .
    </p>
    <p align="left">
      The system stays in a single mode and every particle oscillates with 
      constant angular frequency &#969;<sub>m</sub> if the oscillator chain is 
      initialized in a single mode.

      An arbitrary initial configuration 
      can be expressed as sum of these normal modes.
