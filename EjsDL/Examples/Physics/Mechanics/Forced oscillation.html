      Forced Oscillation
    </h1>
    <p>
      In this simulation, an object that oscillates due to the action of a 
      spring is also the subject of an external periodic force. In this 
      situation, one would expect that the oscillation becomes the sum of both 
      forces, the one resulting from the spring and the external one.

    <h2>
      Experience
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leave all other parameters as in the initial setting and play with the 
      frequency <em>w</em>. Try the values <em>0.0</em>, <em>2.0</em>, <em>0.5</em> 
      and <em>0.85</em>, in this order.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens when the frequency of the external force approaches <em>1</em>? 
      ... The oscillation grows beyond what would be reasonable!
    </p>
    <h2>
      Explain it!
    </h2>
    <p>
      We'll give it a name: <b>resonance</b>, but you should try to explain 
      why it happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final (non-trivial) question is : <b>how does the critical value of <em>w</em> 
      depends on the other parameters: <em>mass</em>, <em>k</em> and <em>A</em>?</b>
