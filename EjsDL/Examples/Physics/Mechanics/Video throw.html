    <h1>
      Video Throw
    </h1>
    <p>
      In this simulation, we superimpose the motion of a ball computed by 
      solving the equations of motion with a video of an actual such motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user must adjust the initial conditions and the parameters so that 
      both motions, the computed and the one displayed by the video, match 
      closely.
