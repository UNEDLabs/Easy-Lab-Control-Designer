            A simple pendulum is a physical abstraction that considers a point 
            mass <i>m</i> that oscillates in a vertical plane at the end of a 
            rod of length <i>L</i> and negligible mass.

    <p>
      If we consider the force exerted by gravity on the mass as constant, <i>g</i>, 
      the motion of a simple pendulum can be modeled by a second order 
      ordinary differential equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equation includes a friction force, with <i>b</i> as friction 
      coefficient, and a time-dependent external torque of the form <i>A*sin(F*t)</i>, 
      which drives the motion. Typically, the pendulum starts oscillating at 
      time <i>t=0</i>, from a given angle with zero initial angular velocity.
