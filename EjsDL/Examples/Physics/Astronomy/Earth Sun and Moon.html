      Earth, Sun, and Moon
    </h2>
    A particular case of the <b>three-body problem</b>, this is a simulation 
    of three bodies interacting according to the universal gravitational law.

    <p>
      We have taken the unscaled data for the <b>Sun</b>, the <b>Earth</b> and 
      the <b>Moon</b> in order to make it more attractive. However, from the 
      point of view of the numerics, it is preferable to rescale so that 
      variables take values near one.

    <p>
      The difficult part is to set up initial conditions so that the Moon is 
      captured by the Earth in its translation orbit around the Sun. In the 
      initialization page, we approximate the real initial position for the 
      Sun, the Earth and the Moon, which produces the situation we are 
      familiar with.

      Activities
    </h2>
   
    <ul>
      <li>
        As an exercise for your students, delete the initialization page (the 
        one with the real situation of the Sun, Earth and Moon) and ask your 
        students to try to reproduce it!
      </li>
      <li>
        Another interesting activity is to pause the simulation, drag the Sun 
        to a different position and play the simulation again to see how this 
        causes the Moon to scape the trajectory.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now that we dragged a body, why not dragging any of the other ones? 
        (Please recall to pause the simulation <u>before</u> dragging any of 
        the bodies, otherwise the simulation may become unstable) </nl>
