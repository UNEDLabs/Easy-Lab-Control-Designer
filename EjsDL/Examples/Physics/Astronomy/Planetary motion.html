            Kepler discovered his three laws of planetary motion after a 
            titanic analysis of years of astronomical observations by Tycho 
            Brahe.

            Newton's inverse-law of gravitation allows us to reformulate this 
            motion in modern terms using the equations for a massless test 
            particle about a particle of mass <i>M</i> located at the origin:

      where <i>M</i> is the combined mass of the Sun and the planet and <i>G</i> 
      is the universal gravitational constant. The <i>xy</i>-coordinates for 
      the massless test particle are the relative position of the planet with 
      respect to the Sun in this two-body approximation of the solar system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial values for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and its derivatives must be 
      taken from direct astronomical observation.In this simulation, they are 
      chosen arbitrarily.
