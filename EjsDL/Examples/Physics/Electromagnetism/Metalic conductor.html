      So, how can a lot of loose electrons cause a metal to be a good 
      conductor? This is because each electron is an electric charge that is 
      free to move. Moving electric charges can make up a current. But this is 
      only true if they move the same way.

      Due to thermal kinetic energy of the electrons and ions in the metal, 
      these conduction electrons move in a random, disordered way, with a 
      velocity close to 10<sup>6</sup> m/s. In total, however, they have zero 
      net velocity because their motion is not ordered.

      However, if an external field is applied, then the net motion of the 
      electrons will follow the field.
