    <h1> Transmission Line</h1>

    <p>
      The simulation program TL is based on solutions of Maxwell&#180;s equations 
      in one dimension, the so-called transmission line equations. The 
      algorithm was developed originally by Zvonko Fazarinc with later 
      additions by Ernesto Mart&#237;n, and has been proven to be stable and 
      correct for all possible border conditions and parameter settings.

      The program TL can be applied primarily to visualize dynamic processes 
      on a double line with superposition and reflection as basic concepts. 
      This is useful not only for ac and high frequency systems but also for 
      dc-currents when the focus is set on transition processes, linking 
      different stationary states, determined by Ohm&#180;s law and Kirchhoff&#180;s 
      laws.
