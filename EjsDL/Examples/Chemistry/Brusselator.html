            The Brusselator is a model, proposed in 1968 by R. Lefever and the 
            Nobel Prize winner I. Prigogine, for an autocatalytic, oscillating 
            chemical reaction. The mechanism for the reaction is given by:

      We will assume that the concentration of the reactants a=[A] and b=[B] 
      is kept artificially constant and are interested in the evolution of the 
      intermediate products, x = [X] and y = [Y]. This system can exhibit, for 
      appropriate values of the parameters, unexpected oscillatory behavior. 
      (Hint: Increase the value of k<sub>2</sub>.)

      The simulation plots a set of sample trajectories in phase-space, which 
      start from different initial conditions, for the same values of the 
      parameters.
