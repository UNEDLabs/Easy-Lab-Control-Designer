      Cooling water data
    </h2>
    <p>
      This example shows how to read (and plot)&#160; data from an external text 
      file. This file is packaged together with the simulation in the 
      EJS'&#160;generated JAR file.

      The data corresponds to the cooling of hot water in an insulated (grey 
      plot) and a regular (black plot) cup under the effect of the outdoor 
      temperature (given by the blue plot). The data was kindly provided by 
      Roger Frost (<a href="http://www.rogerfrost.com">www.rogerfrost.com</a>).
