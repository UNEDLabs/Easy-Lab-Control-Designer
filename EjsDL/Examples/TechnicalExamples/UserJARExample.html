    <h3>
      Using your own JAR libraries
    </h3>
    <p>
      This example shows how to use user defined JAR files in&#160; EJS. The JAR 
      file used here is quite simple. It just contains a class with a single 
      method to compute the thrid power of a double number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps to follow are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create your source code which must be in one or more packages. (See 
        the sample code for constructing a function f(x) = x*x*x in the description
		pages of this model.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Compile this code properly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a JAR file (using Java's jar utility) for the generated classes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Copy this JAR file into your workspace source directory (preferably 
        under the same directory of your source XML file).
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the simulation information panel (top-right icon of EJS) and add 
        this JAR file to the list of 'JAR Libraries' as indicated in the 
        'Option and files' tab of the panel.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can now use this method (fully qualified) as any other Java method. 
      In our example, the method is called as in: <tt>mypackage.MyMathClass.power3(x); 
      </tt>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to make it easy to use this method, you can add <tt>mypackage.MyMathClass 
      </tt>to the list of import statements of the 'Option and files' tab of 
      the simulation information panel, and then call the method simply as in 
      : <tt>MyMathClass.power3(x);</tt>
    </p>
