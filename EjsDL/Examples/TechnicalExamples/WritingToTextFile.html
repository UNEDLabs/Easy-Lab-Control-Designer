    <h2>
      Writing to text file
    </h2>
    <p>
      This example shows how to open write a text file with data from the simulation to it.
    </p>
    <p>
    When the user clicks a button, the file is created 
    and subsequent data produced by the simulation evolution is written to it.
    </p>
    <p>
    When the user click another button, the file is closed and is ready to be used by any other application.
    </p>
    <p>
    The next time the user click the creation button, the program checks that an existing file
    is not overwritten.
