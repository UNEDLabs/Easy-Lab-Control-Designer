            This is a simulation of a planar N-body problem with initial 
            conditions that result into all bodies following the same curve 
            (at different times), in a sort of dance in the plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            The resulting trajectories are unstable, and sooner or later, the 
            choreography will brake.
