      Taylor method for a simple pendulum
    </h1>
    <p>
      This simulation implements the Taylor algorithm and plots the 
      approximated solution for a simple, undriven pendulum for the algorithm 
      including first, second, and third order derivative terms of the Taylor 
      expansion, using the same value of h=0.1.

    <p>
      The simulation shows the typical behavior of Taylor methods. The first 
      order method (the red plot), also known as Euler method, provides a very 
      poor approximation to the solution. Second order terms (the blue plot) 
      do a better job, but still not perfect. The solution which includes 
      third order terms (the black one) is almost indistinguishable from the 
      true solution.
