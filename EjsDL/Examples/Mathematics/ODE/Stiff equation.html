            An ordinary differential equation is said to be <b><i>stiff</i></b> 
            when its solutions comprise two or more terms that change at 
            speeds which differ in several orders of magnitude.

            Consider the simple one-dimensional initial value problem:
          </p>
          <p>
            x'(t) = -1000 x(t) + 3000 - 2000 exp(-t), x(0) = 0,

    <p>
      which has the exact solution x(t) = 3 - 997/999 exp(-1000t) - 2000/999 
      exp(-t). The solution contains a slow-changing exponential together with 
      a fast-changing one. Although the fast exponential quickly contributes 
      with only very small values, its presence forces a typical explicit 
      algorithm to keep a small step size, even after the transient part of 
      the solution is considerably small. This is because of the poor 
      stability properties of explicit algorithms.

      This simulation plots the real solution (in black) together with a 
      solution found using a Runge-Kutta 5(4) adaptive algorithm (red) and a 
      solution found using the Radau5 method (blue), which is especially 
      suited for stiff equations. Notice that the Radau5 method allows for 
      larger step sizes with very good accuracy and stability properties.
