          <p>
            Arenstorf orbits are closed trajectories of the restricted 
            three-body problem. That is, two bodies of masses &#181; and 1-&#181; moving 
            in a circular rotation, and a third body of negligible mass moving 
            in the same plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            The computation of these orbits is very sensible to small errors 
            and are a good test for the accuracy of numerical methods for 
            solving Ordinary Differential Equations.

      This simulation compares the solution of two of these orbits using both 
      a 4th-order fixed step and a 5(4) variable step Runge-Kutta algorithm. 
      The adaptive solver uses an event to find the period of the orbit and 
      stop there. Both the computations of the adaptive solver and the event 
      are done with the step size and the tolerance indicated.

      The middle row of fields at the bottom of the window shows the computed 
      values, while the lower one shows the expected values.
