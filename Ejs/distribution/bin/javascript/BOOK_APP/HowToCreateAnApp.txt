Steps to install ionic correctly in your computer
=================================================

This needs to be done only once, no matter how many Book Apps you create

- Before we start, make sure you have Node.js installed in your system: https://nodejs.org/en/

- The next two commands install the generic cordova and ionic platforms 
  - $ sudo npm install -g cordova
  - $ sudo npm install -g ionic

- The next two commands install specific packages that we will use in our particular projects 
  - $ sudo npm install angular-ui-router
  - $ sudo npm install angular-sanitize




Steps to create an App called, say, MyBookApp
=================================================

This needs to be done once per Book Apps you create

- Create a new blank Ionic project: replace MyBookApp with whatever name you want to give to your project.
  This will correspond to a new directory in your hard disk. 
  - $ ionic start MyBookApp blank

   (This takes a few seconds... When asked: "Create an ionic.io account to send Push Notifications and use the Ionic View app?" you can answer no: n)
 
- Change to the newly create directory (again, change replace MyBookApp with th ename you uses in the step before)
  - $ cd MyBookApp

- Add target platforms iOS and Android 
  - $ ionic platform add ios
  (Actually, not needed on MacOS)
  
  - $ ionic platform add android
  (You may need to edit /android/project.properties, to set the correct Android target version for your device)

- Add particular plug-ins that we use in our projects 
  - $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-screen-orientation
  - $ cordova plugin add https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser.git
  - $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine  (This one is optional. Might improve speed on speed-savvy simulations)

- Now, UNZIP the file you created with EjsS and work to modify the "www" folder of your project:
  - copy all files and folders in your ZIP into your project's "www",
    even if this means replacing existing files and folders.
    (Actually, only the project's "lib" folder will remain unchanged)

  You are now ready to test and build the app

- to test the APP: $ ionic serve
- exit the server by entering 'q'

FINE TUNNING:
=============

- You may want to revise the following files in "www/other_pages"
     - about.html
     - copyright.html
     - cover.html
     - references.html
     - title_page.html

- You can always test the APP using $ ionic serve again

DEPLOYING
=========

- You may want to edit the following entries in ionic files of your project:
  - bower.json -> Change the "name" property
  - config.xml -> Change the name, description and author entries
  - package.json -> change the name and description entries

- Change the icon and splash images in "resources" and type: $ ionic resources 
    Make sure you use images of the same size of those you replace.
  - ask Ionic to create platform specific images: $ ionic resources 

- to create an XCode project for iOS: $ ionic build ios
  - Open the platform/ios/MyBookApp.xcodeproj file with XCode
  - You can run on your iPad (connect it with a cable to your Mac) and it should work.
  
  - Before exporting you may need to do a number of things:
    - Add this line to your Build Settings -> Header Search Paths:
      "$(OBJROOT)/UninstalledProducts/$(PLATFORM_NAME)/include"
    - Prepare a distributable archive (for registered iOS devices): Product -> Archive

- to test for Android: $ ionic build android
   When successfull, the last message will tell you where is the android-debug.apk file
   that was generated. Send this file to your Android devide and install it. It should work.
